## What is this?

This is a portfolio; a collection of artifacts, information and more about my experience in the education program.

## Thank you for stopping by!

Feel free to checkout any of the above tabs. I have also made the source code available [here](http://github.com/EricMarcantonio/teaching-portfolio)

# Biggest Highlight
