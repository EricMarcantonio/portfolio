## Jan 18, 2023 Came in an extra day
## Jan 19, 2023 Reid Out
## Jan 26, 2023 Snow Day
Discussed educational philosophy with my mentor teacher
Marked the practical coding assessments for the grade 11’s
## Feb 2, 2023 PA Day
Inputted marks from Rubric into Google Classroom
Inputted marks from Google Classroom into MarkBook
## Feb 9, 2023 Class
Topic: Encoding and Encryption

Observations:
Have the students start with trying to create their own system, and get them to see the faults.
Adding in the homework from the day earlier - sort of like doing the readings before a lecture.

What about appending a 0x to each hex, to show students that it isn’t an int?

No carry over might be too confusing; I haven't heard of a no carry over, but I am also not the best at adding hex/binary.

What did I do?:
Started a rapport with a student in hopes of keeping them on the right track.

11UC
Topic: I/O
Observations:
Went over the true basics of coding. Things like “round” brackets are things that I need to add into my language so that truly beginner students can learn. Coding for so long, I can sometimes just assume they know what I am talking about.

Checks the time to keep the lesson on track.

Included students in the design of the program, instead of just giving them the assignment

12UC:
Topic: Subprograms
Observations:
Included the class in the explanation of the a subprogram. Students were part of the “why” we need subprograms.

Wrote code by hand on the whiteboard and had the students breakdown the subprogram themselves. A great way to have students learn from what they know; pen and paper.

## Feb 21, 2023

11UC
Topic: String Manipulation
Observations: Nothing, I taught
Lessons learned:

Missing part of the assignment where students needed to add instructions for the end user, many students had questions about it.

Needed to give more examples of storing method outputs in variables, and storing them in new variables. Maybe go over “catching” the input.

Better engagement with the class. Still need to work on picking on students to answer questions. Instead of singling out a student, pick a row to give an answer with a spokesperson.

12U
Topic: Subprograms extended
Observations: 
To break problem down into smaller pieces, whiteboard it with a chart
Keeping students on track is important, some are always on their phones

## Mar 9, 2023

12U
Topic: Subprograms extended
Observations: 
Product management - noticed when students were completing their work, and changed it up accordingly

Included the class in Student input for feedback (“What would you like to today?”, Giving choice instead of telling them)

## Mar 23, 2023

Object before class

Keeping students engaged by having them add stuff to their car

Overall expectations are generally graded, and specifics are brought up


## March 30, 2023

Students were reviewing material

## April 5, 2023
Went over a tougher concepts like stepwise refinement

- Don't erase the board at any point when teaching; check with students if needed

## April 12th to the 28th

Completely took over the 2 sections of ICS3U. See Lessons for all of the lessons worked!

The main things I learned in the 2 weeks was understanding that highschools students need a bit more "hand holding" then university students. Although the plans for the next couple of weeks were told to them before hand, I had to make it a habit of reminding them each day, just to make sure they heard.

Evaluation was also a new experience for me. Students asking for higher marks (a theme at Xavier) was something new to me. Having to tell students that they did not show the correct work to justify the mark, was something that was new to me. It was one of the hardest things to say, as I wanted all my students to succeed.

The biggest difference between the weekly placements and the block was consistently seeing students everyday; and the report I was able to make with them. It was easier to manage the class, once I was in there everyday.

The last 2 weeks was the most enjoyable - and it didn't feel like work. I was excited to go to school (especially when teaching the stuff I am passionate about), and the students were equally engaged.
