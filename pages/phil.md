# My Teaching Philosophy

Teaching is a civic duty. I decided to pursue teaching because I wanted to make an impact on the the next generation of students.

My Philosophy is simple: how would I want my children to be taught? Compassion, empathy and a desire to learn are all attributes I would want for my children, and they are attributes that I would express as a teacher.

I also believe in creating inclusive classrooms. Understanding that you can't "judge a fish on its ability to climb a tree" is important; recognizing the strengths of each student is important in making an impact on them.

My goals for student learning is to help them see how they can make an impact on the world. They have so much potential, and all it takes is 1 caring adult to propel them forward

I teach in a very relaxed way; I am a Highschool teacher, and often times you are able to connect with students better when they don't view you as "the mean teacher". This isn't to say there aren't rules, and students are exempted from them; it means to be a caring adult.

I measure my effectiveness of my teaching through progress of students learning. Students performance, participation, and genuine knowledge are all factors that I measure success by.
