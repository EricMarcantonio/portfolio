# Who am I?

{<img src="/images/bitmoji.png" width='200' height='200'/>}

It is nice to meet you. I am a Software Engineer by trade, who also is completing their Bachelor of Education at York University.

### Highschool

I graduated from {<a target="_blank" href="https://cawthrapark.peelschools.org/">Cawthra Park Secondary School</a>}
in 2018. I wasn't part of any Art Major there; but I did learn how to play gutiar!

### University

I went (and at the time of this writing, still attend) York University. I joined as a {<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yorku.ca/edu/students/bed-concurrent/">Concurrent Education</a>}
student with my undergrad in {<a target="_blank" href="https://lassonde.yorku.ca/academics/computer-science">Computer Science</a>}. I started a club in university, called the Lassonde Security Club; it's main focus? To teach students
more about Cyber Security, give them hands-on workshops, and have students network with professionals.

### Work Experience

Throughout my undergrad, I loved working in the industry. I completed 6 internships in 4 years, including government, banking, consuting, and eccommerce. If you want to learn more, refer to [Resume](/resume).

### Why am I a teacher?

I get this question a lot, and in short: it is what I love to do. I truly believe the best way for me to make impact on the next generation is through education.
I also believe that if you know something; you should share it. In my experience in technology, people tend to gatekeep information (they don't want to share).
Also, in conjunction with a society the relies so heavily on technology, and an expanding job market, the need for more students to understand the basics of computing is greater now then ever.
