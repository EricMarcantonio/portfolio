My first school placement was amazing. I was able to get real classroom experience, and work with a Mentor teacher who believed in students.

# Extra Curricular

## Coding Club
I worked with the Coding Club during my placement, where I had a focus on Cyber Security. We worked through problems (called CTF's or capture the flag), and they learned some security concepts.

We also had an introduction to Linux using a puzzle based learning system (Over the Wire) and had many talks about industry, jobs, and life!

## Badminton

I assisted my Mentor Teacher with the badminton team, supporting the team during games, tournament and practice. I created a bond with the students, pushing them during games, and making an impact outside of the court. It was one of my most enjoyable parts of working with students during my term, and solidified my desire to run extra-curricular sports when I go full time.

# The school

Xavier was one of the nicest schools I have ever seen. They had a ton of amenities, including a mechanic shop class.

Here are the times for the school:
