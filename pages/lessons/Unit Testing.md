# What is unit testing?
- testing of subprograms
- What are some of the inputs thats our function could take?
- What if someone else is going to use our code. Do you think they will "follow" the happy path?
- using assert

## How do we use unit testing in our code?

- TDD: What is it, and how would we use it?


### Activity

We are going to take your Zodiac programs, and create unit tests for your subprograms.

For example if you have a function that looks like this:

```
def getSign(day, month):
    ...
```

What are some inputs `getSign` would take?

How should we handle them?
