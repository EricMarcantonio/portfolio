# Portfolio

What is it?

Why do we need it?


## Creating our own portfolio

- Students are to create a github account with a personal email address, with a simple GitHub handle

- Create a repo using their handle name, and `README.md`

- Write something about them (that the public is okay to know about), and share it me
