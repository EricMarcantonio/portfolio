# Sub Programs - Args

- Why should we pass arguments?

## Default values for arguments

- Show students with a =
- Talk about how this is bad practice

## Pass by Reference vs Pass By Value

Reference (Mutable): `list`, `set`, and `dict`

Value (Immutable): `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `tuple`, and `complex`

- Show an example of pass by reference working
- Show an example of creating new objects, using the copy constructors
